# Definitive Automated Realtek RTW89 Wi-Fi Driver Installation Script
#
# This script is the final result of our detailed troubleshooting. It automates
# every successful step we discovered, creating a reliable, one-click solution.
#
# It will:
# 1. Update your system and install ALL necessary dependencies.
# 2. Download the latest driver source code.
# 3. Automatically patch the code to fix the known compilation error.
# 4. Perform a clean, manual installation to avoid all installer bugs.
# 5. Fix the known driver filename bug.
# 6. *** NEW: Create the driver options file to fix cold boot & dual-boot issues. ***
# 7. Load the newly installed driver.
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Save this script as a file, for example: "install_wifi_final.sh".
# 2. Make the script executable:  chmod +x install_wifi_final.sh
# 3. Run the script with sudo:      sudo ./install_wifi_final.sh
